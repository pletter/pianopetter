I'm currently living in the mega metropolis Lagos, where 
I've started a live music revolution called Kilonsele. It's all about 
playing an insane amount of concerts for local communities, 
thereby making live music accesible to the people. We also provide
team work music training for young local talents, who will be the 
backbone of sustaining the project once I get too old to play 
2 million concerts a year.
